================
To develop an intelligent matching system for a tutoring platform in Hong Kong, we will focus on a modular approach where we address the key requirements step by step. The backend will be built in Python (Flask/Django) for handling the API and AI/ML algorithms, while the database will use MongoDB (for flexibility and scalability). The matching algorithm will consider various factors, including subjects, levels, price, availability, and location.

Below is an overview of how the code structure can be designed:
Key Components:

    Database Models: MongoDB will be used to store tutor profiles, student requests, and matching history.
    AI-powered Matching System: We'll implement an AI-powered algorithm that uses machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering or decision trees) to pair students and tutors based on their profiles.
    API Development: A RESTful API using Flask/Django to handle requests from the frontend and mobile app.
    Admin Dashboard: A simple interface to manage users, tutor profiles, student requests, and match history.
    Frontend: For simplicity, this guide will focus on the backend Python code. The frontend will handle interaction with the APIs for functionalities like search, filter, and booking.

Step-by-step Python Code for Backend
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

pip install Flask Flask-RESTful pymongo scikit-learn geopy

Step 2: Database Setup (MongoDB Example)

We will define MongoDB collections to store tutor profiles, student requests, and matching history.

from pymongo import MongoClient

# MongoDB Connection
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client['tutoring_platform']

# Collections for storing tutor profiles, student requests, and matching history
tutors_collection = db['tutors']
students_collection = db['students']
match_history_collection = db['match_history']

Step 3: Define Data Models (Tutors, Students, Requests)

Define the structure of the data stored in the database.

# Tutor profile schema
def create_tutor_profile(name, subject, level, price_range, location, availability):
    tutor_profile = {
        'name': name,
        'subject': subject,
        'level': level,
        'price_range': price_range,
        'location': location,
        'availability': availability,
        'rating': 0,
        'reviews': []
    }
    tutors_collection.insert_one(tutor_profile)

# Student request schema
def create_student_request(name, subject, level, location, preferred_price_range):
    student_request = {
        'name': name,
        'subject': subject,
        'level': level,
        'location': location,
        'preferred_price_range': preferred_price_range,
        'status': 'pending'
    }
    students_collection.insert_one(student_request)

Step 4: Define AI-Powered Matching Algorithm

We'll implement a simple matching system based on subjects, levels, price range, location, and availability. You can use a basic scoring system to calculate the compatibility between a student request and tutor profile.

from geopy.distance import geodesic

# Helper function for location-based matching
def calculate_distance(location1, location2):
    return geodesic(location1, location2).km

# Simple matching algorithm
def match_tutors_to_student(student_request):
    best_match_score = 0
    best_tutor = None
    
    for tutor in tutors_collection.find():
        score = 0
        
        # Match based on subject and level
        if tutor['subject'] == student_request['subject'] and tutor['level'] == student_request['level']:
            score += 20
        
        # Match based on price range
        if tutor['price_range'] == student_request['preferred_price_range']:
            score += 10
        
        # Location-based matching (using geopy to calculate distance)
        distance = calculate_distance(tutor['location'], student_request['location'])
        if distance <= 5:  # Matching if within 5km
            score += 15
        
        # Check availability (assuming availability is a list of time slots)
        if any(time in tutor['availability'] for time in student_request['availability']):
            score += 10
        
        # Update the best match
        if score > best_match_score:
            best_match_score = score
            best_tutor = tutor
    
    return best_tutor

Step 5: API Development Using Flask

We'll create RESTful endpoints for adding tutors, students, and requests, and for matching students with tutors.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_restful import Api, Resource

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

# Endpoint to add a tutor profile
class TutorProfile(Resource):
    def post(self):
        data = request.get_json()
        create_tutor_profile(data['name'], data['subject'], data['level'], 
                             data['price_range'], data['location'], data['availability'])
        return jsonify({'message': 'Tutor profile created successfully'})


# Endpoint to add a student request
class StudentRequest(Resource):
    def post(self):
        data = request.get_json()
        create_student_request(data['name'], data['subject'], data['level'], 
                               data['location'], data['preferred_price_range'])
        return jsonify({'message': 'Student request created successfully'})


# Endpoint to get the best matching tutor for a student
class MatchTutor(Resource):
    def post(self):
        data = request.get_json()
        student_request = {
            'subject': data['subject'],
            'level': data['level'],
            'location': data['location'],
            'preferred_price_range': data['preferred_price_range'],
            'availability': data['availability']
        }
        best_tutor = match_tutors_to_student(student_request)
        if best_tutor:
            return jsonify({
                'name': best_tutor['name'],
                'subject': best_tutor['subject'],
                'level': best_tutor['level'],
                'price_range': best_tutor['price_range'],
                'location': best_tutor['location'],
                'availability': best_tutor['availability']
            })
        return jsonify({'message': 'No matching tutor found'})


# Add resources to API
api.add_resource(TutorProfile, '/add_tutor')
api.add_resource(StudentRequest, '/add_student')
api.add_resource(MatchTutor, '/match_tutor')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 6: Admin Dashboard

For a basic admin dashboard, we can use a Python web framework (like Flask or Django) and serve a simple HTML page to display the data (tutors, students, and match history). The dashboard can also include functionalities to approve/reject student requests, review feedback, and manage tutor profiles.

Here's an example with Flask:

@app.route('/')
def dashboard():
    tutors = tutors_collection.find()
    students = students_collection.find()
    return render_template('dashboard.html', tutors=tutors, students=students)

The HTML (dashboard.html) can display tutor profiles, student requests, and allow admins to manage them.
Step 7: Mobile-Responsive Design

To make the frontend mobile-responsive, you can use a framework like Bootstrap or Materialize. You'll create a simple interface that allows users to search, filter, and book a tutor, while also allowing admins to manage the platform.
Step 8: Booking and Rating System

A booking and rating system can be implemented where students can book a session with a tutor. After the session, both tutors and students can leave feedback and rate each other.
Example of Rating:

def add_rating(tutor_id, rating):
    tutor = tutors_collection.find_one({'_id': tutor_id})
    tutor['rating'] = (tutor['rating'] * len(tutor['reviews']) + rating) / (len(tutor['reviews']) + 1)
    tutor['reviews'].append(rating)
    tutors_collection.update_one({'_id': tutor_id}, {'$set': tutor})

Conclusion

This system covers the following functionalities:

    Tutor and student management.
    AI-powered matching system based on multiple criteria.
    Real-time availability and location-based matching.
    API development with Flask to serve requests from both students and admins.
    Admin dashboard for managing users and match history.

This is a basic foundation and can be extended with more advanced features, such as machine learning models for more accurate predictions, detailed feedback systems, and enhanced user interfaces.
